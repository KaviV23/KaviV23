### 👋 Hi, I’m Kavi
🌱 I’m in my 3rd year of University studying Software Engineering.  
👀 Technology has always been a passion of mine since I was a kid. Whether it be flashing custom ROMs on my phone or installing different operating systems (including MacOS🤫) on my moms HP laptop. Programming however has been a newfound interest of mine. Currently, I'm learning React development with Next.js in my free time. I also recently got into messing around with home servers.
