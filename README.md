### 👋 Hi, I’m Kavi
🌱 I’m in my 3rd year of University studying Software Engineering.

👀 Technology has always been a passion of mine since I was a kid. It started out with me flashing custom ROMs on my Android phone and installing different operating systems on my moms old HP. Programming has been a newfound interest of mine and I've been loving it ever since. I'm currently learning React.js development with Next.js in my free time. I also recently got into hosting my own home server.
