### 👋 Hi, I’m Kavi
🌱 I’m in my 3rd year of University studying Software Engineering.

❤️ Technology has always been a passion of mine since I was a kid. It started out with me flashing custom ROMs on my Android phone and playing around with different operating systems on my old laptop. Programming has been a newfound interest of mine and I've been loving it ever since. I'm currently more experienced in front-end development with vanilla HTML/CSS for web development, and Flutter and Android Jetpack for mobile app development. However, I'm now looking to specialize into back-end development, exploring embedded systems and more. Other than tech, I also enjoy cars, photography and travelling!
