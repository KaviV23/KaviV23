### 👋 Hi, I’m Kavi
🌱 I’m in my 3rd year of University studying Software Engineering.  
👀 Technology has always been a passion of mine since I was a kid. It started out with me flashing custom ROMs on my Android phone and installing different operating systems on my moms old HP. Programming has been a newfound interest of mine. Currently, I'm learning React development with Next.js in my free time. I also recently got into messing around with home servers.
