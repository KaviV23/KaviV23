# Hi👋, I’m Kavi
🌱 I’m in my 3rd year of University studying Software Engineering.

❤️‍🔥 Technology has always been a passion of mine since I was a kid. It started out with me flashing custom ROMs on my Android phone and playing around with different operating systems on my old laptop. Programming has been a newfound interest of mine and I've been loving it ever since.
